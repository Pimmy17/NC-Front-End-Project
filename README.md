# **Andy's Front End Project**

### **Summary of Project:**

This project is to combine 2 weeks worth of knowledge from Northcoder's front end course with the already created [back end project](https://github.com/Pimmy17/NC-Back-End-Project) I had created earlier.
The App has been created in the style of Reddit, where a user can read articles and comments, post new comments and vote on both articles and comments.

The Hosted Version of this project can be found [here](https://andyp-nc-news-project.netlify.app/)

### **Setup Instructions**

1. **Clone:**

On the [main page](https://github.com/Pimmy17/NC-Front-End-Project) of the repo, click on the **Green** button that says 'Code'. From the drop down menu, either click the overlapping squares button to the right of the HTTPS address (this automatically copies the .git address) or highlight the whole HTTPS address and right click and select copy.
Then head over to your terminal command line and enter in:

```
$ git clone <insert copied HTTPS address>
i.e $ git clone https://github.com/Pimmy17/NC-Front-End-Project.git
```

After running this it will ask you to enter your github username and password/access token.

Finally to access the file in VS Code:

```
Enter the Project file using:
$ cd NC-Front-End-Project
Then
$ code .
```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

After cloning, you will need to install the dependencies in your terminal to allow tests to be run by running.

```
- $ npm install
```

3. **Running the App:**

In order to view the current state of the App, and see live changes, you will need to run:

```
- $ npm start
```

Enjoy!
